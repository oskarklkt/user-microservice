# DriverManager
### Description
Very basic implementation of the DataSource interface. It is a simple factory for Connection objects. 
It is not recommended for production use. It's the oldest mechanism for connecting to a database with Java.
### Pros
- Simple to use
- Easy to understand
- Good for small applications
- Good for learning purposes
- Easy to configure
### Cons
- Not recommended for production use
- Not thread-safe
- Less Flexible: Configuration changes (like switching databases) can require code changes, 
as connection details are often hardcoded or configured programmatically within the application.
- Doesn't support connection pooling

# DataSource
### Description
The DataSource interface is a standard interface for connecting to a database. 
It is preferred over DriverManager for production use.
### Pros
- Thread-safe
- Supports connection pooling
- More flexible: Configuration changes (like switching databases) can be done without code changes,
- Supports distributed transactions

### Cons
- More complex to use
- More complex to configure
- More difficult to understand
(U can use some other implementation of DataSource like HikariDataSource, which makes it easier to use and configure.)
